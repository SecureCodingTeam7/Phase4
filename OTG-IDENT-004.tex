\chapter{Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account (OTG-IDENT-004)}
\section{Observation}
We observed that the password recovery function is leaking information about existing accounts.You get immediately an negative feedback if you are inserting a non existing account email address and a positive feedback for an existing  one.

\section{Discovery}

The corresponding code is placed in ForgotPassword.php, shown in Listing \ref{listing:forgotPassword} . Before a new password for the user is generated, the entered email address is validated.  If a account with the email address is not existing, a JSON file is sent to the browser and its message is displayed via javascript. Else a new password is generated and sent via mail. A JSON File with a confirmation message is sent to the browser as well. Due to the fact, that the webservice is a REST-Service, you can automate this guessing process by sending a POST request to <ip>/rest/index.php with the name of he service, in our case "forgotPassword" and the email address as arguments. This is done by a script(Chapter \ref{appendix:validate_via_response}), which a text file with email addresses and returns the ones that are valid. The only disadvantage of this approach, is the fact, that the user are receiving emails with new passwords. That could alarm some of them, but nonetheless, some will not notice it.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= Validating Email before generating new Passowrd  line 54-59 ,label=listing:forgotPassword]
$hash = new Hash();
$user = new User();

$user = $user->findByEmail($emailAddress);

if( !$user->getId() ) {
$parser->setStatusCode( STATUS_CODE_ERROR )
->setStatusMessage( "Email address not found." )
->parse();
}

$newPassword = $hash->createRandomString( 15 );
$saltedPassword = $hash->saltPassword($newPassword, $user->getSalt());

$user->setPassword($saltedPassword)->save();

Mail::sendNewPassword($user, $newPassword);

/***************************
* 3. Parse Response
**************************/

$parser->setStatusCode( STATUS_CODE_SUCCESS )
->setStatusMessage( "New password set" )
->parse();
\end{lstlisting}



\section{Likelihood}
It's very likely that attackers will use this vulnerability to guess some user accounts, since they receive a graphical feedback if the account exists.


\section{Implication} 
This vulnerability leads to a disclosure of user accounts. The impact of that depends on the actions which are possible with a valid user account. In our case there are no possible attacks without knowing the password for this account.


\section{Recommendations}
For the Password Recovery, you simply don't notify the user if an account if the email exists, but always print a generic message.
