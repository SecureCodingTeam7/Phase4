\section{Test defenses against application mis-use (OTG-BUSLOGIC-007)}
\subsection{Observation}
In the current application there are no mechanisms implemented to detect intrusion or other attacks. There is also no event logging, except for the standard Apache log files.

Likelihood: high \newline

Impact: low\newline

Risk: medium\newline
\subsection{Discovery}
This vulnerability was discovered while reading the OWASP testing guide.
\subsection{Implications}
If an attacker tries to misuse the system there is no way to recognize these ``unpleasant actions''.
\subsection{Recommendation}
Implement basic event logging and maybe intrusion detection.
