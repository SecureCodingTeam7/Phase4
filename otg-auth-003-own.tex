\section{Testing for Weak lock out mechanism (OTG-AUTHN-003)}
\subsection{Observation}
Our app doesn't use any lock out mechanism for the login process. 

Likelihood: high \newline

Impact: medium\newline

Risk: medium\newline
\subsection{Discovery}
This vulnerability was immediately found after completion of the login process.

An Attacker can run brute force attacks against our application in order to guess user credentials.
