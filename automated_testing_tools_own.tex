\chapter{Testing PHP with automated Tools}

\section{Testing PHP Code}
Like mentioned previously the automated testing tools RATS and RIPS doesn't support object-oriented PHP code. Therefore they do not return any valuable output.
While RIPS does not return any output, RATS claims some vulnerabilities in third party libraries, like PHPMailer and FDPI, shown in Listing \ref{listing:rats}.
All this vulnerabilities are basing on the fact that the libraries do not valid there input. 
We not further tested this vulnerabilities because we sanitize all of our data which is delegated to these libraries like an email address.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Output of tool RATS claiming vulnerabilities of PHPMailer library,label = listing:rats]
/var/www/Phase3/phase3//include/phpmailer/class.smtp.php:660: High: mail
Arguments 1, 2, 4 and 5 of this function may be passed to an external 
program. (Usually sendmail). Under Windows, they will be passed to a
remote email server. If these values are derived from user input, make
sure they are properly formatted and contain no unexpected characters or
extra data.
