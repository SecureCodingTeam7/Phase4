\chapter{Testing for SQL Injection ()OTG-INPVAL-005)}

\section{Observation}

The app is not vulnerable to sql injections.  The reason is the usage of the php library sqli, which creates query objects instead of directly using strings as queries.
 Another important reason is that, the app is consistent in its behaviour. All database request are delegated to the class DBModel.php in backend/resr/include. So there's no chance of finding vulnerable database requests.
